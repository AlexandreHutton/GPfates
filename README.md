This repository contains code for GPfates, whichs models transcriptional cell fates as mixtures of Gaussian Processes. 
It allows for the identification of cell branching points and dynamic activity of genes in scRNA-seq data. The code was 
developed as part of the paper, "[Single-cell RNA-seq and computational analysis using temporal mixture modelling 
resolves Th1/Tfh fate bifurcation in malaria](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5365145/)".
